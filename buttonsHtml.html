<!-- here is where the html code will be posted and updated as it goes. Let's be better about leaving notes that describe everything,
 even if the code itself isn't very long-->

<a href="#">
  <i id="clock-icon" class="fa-solid fa-clock"></i> 
</a>

<!-- button #2! I'm a smiley face! And I tell the user that they are doing great! -->

<!-- button #3! I'm pi! And I pop out the answer for pi (3.14) or a flavor of pie! -->

<!-- button #4! Muffin button! I just pop up a muffin or the string 'POP!'-->

<!-- button #5! Rainbow button! I change the background of the text block to a different color!-->

<!-- button #6! Bad/Good button! I alternate the smiley face from happy to sad! -->

<div class="time-display">
  <h1>Time is <span id="time" > </span></h1>
</div> 

<!-- create a box with the Div element, much like a calculator, that displays the results of a button.
also create 4 more buttons. One that displays a random array of quotes like a magic 8 ball | one that clears out the display | one that presents a "lucky number" |
and lastly one that changes the display box color any color in the rainbow spectrum -->
